		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Hi! My name is Sue Pham. I am a senior at UC Davis studying design with a focus in UX/UI and web development, and I am also minoring in communications. I currently work at the UC Davis Computer Lab Management as a computer room consultant. I assist staff, faculty, and students with computer network, software, hardware issues. I work on projects for the labs on campus, and I interact with a large diversity of people. Over the summer, I was an intern at Myovant Sciences, Inc. in Brisbane, CA as an IT Consultant. I maintained the technology infrastructure and worked with the IT team to prevent any technology disruptions in the company. As of right now, I am actively looking for a job as I finish up my final quarter.</p>
		<p>I have always loved working with technology ever since I received my first computer. I especially enjoyed going on Tumblr and tweaking my website code to fit my aesthetics and purpose. This interest followed me to my college career where I was able to learn more about user-centered design creating wireframes and prototypes for web design. I also got to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and I was able to build this very site you are on!</p>
		<p>I hope to challenge myself further to see what possibilities I can design and code.</p>
