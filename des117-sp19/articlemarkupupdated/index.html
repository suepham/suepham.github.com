            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Charles Eames: “Eventually, everything connects.” The idea behind the cloud was the vision that information and data can be stored on a remote server where it can be easily accessible anytime on any device. There was no longer a need to use physical storage such as a hard drive because information could be backed up instantaneously to the cloud. Apple used these ideas to create and popularize a new way of data storage to connect all Apple products and coined it the iCloud. With iCloud, Apple users can now store their information into the cloud without backing up the data onto the computer, and this forever changed the way information and data would be stored on future Apple products. For years, cloud technology was used in various software forms, but iCloud propelled the industry into mainstreaming cloud technology and making it readily available for the average person setting a new standard for how modern cloud computing should be.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of the cloud began in the 1960s with Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, the director of Behavioral Sciences Command and Control Research for Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) (Miertschin and Willis). He had a vision of a world interconnected with computers and that people could view, store and share information anywhere at any time. With funding from ARPA, he created a computing system called “Intergalactic Computer Network,” which later came to be the World Wide Web (Miertschin and Willis). Even though the cloud was not fully developed, Licklider had the idea of the cloud in mind and he knew the Internet was necessary for cloud access (Miertschin and Willis). However, the lack of capable technology at the time prevented Licklider’s idea from progressing forward, and it was eventually abandoned for over twenty years (Miertschin and Willis). The idea came back into the public’s mind once again in 1994 with AT&T’s PersonaLink, where information could be stored and shared with others using “virtual storage areas” (Miertschin and Willis). This second attempt at utilizing the cloud also failed to take off, but it allowed the idea to be reintroduced to the industry and influenced developing technologies. These efforts eventually led to more successful software programs to be developed like Amazon Cloud Drive, Google Drive, and Apple’s iCloud.</p>

            <h2>iCloud</h2>
            <h3>Release</h3>
            <p>The initial release of iCloud on October 12, 2011, transformed the way consumers would use their Apple products. This new service would be compatible with applications on your iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, and PC and it would be able to store the content automatically while pushing it to all your connected devices (Muller and Neumayr). Since this happens wirelessly and instantly, it would be a mindless and simple process that “just works” (Muller and Neumayr). </p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>iCloud included services from its former service MobileMe, a subscription pack for online services by Apple, such as mail, calendar, and contacts (Muller and Neumayr). Calendars can be shared with others, and emails are constantly updated on all devices (Muller and Neumayr). Apps and books that were bought from the app store can be downloaded on every device without the need to pay for it twice for another device and it was easier to download the apps and books with the consumer’s purchase history stored through iCloud (Muller and Neumayr). Documents could be stored and updated using Apple applications like Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, and the documents could be changed and edited at any time (Muller and Neumayr). With Photo Stream, photos taken could be pushed to all Apple products, so it can be easily shared on other devices like on an Apple TV (Muller and Neumayr). Your iTunes music can be transferred from one device to another automatically without needing to connect your device to your computer and manually transferring the music (Muller and Neumayr). With iCloud, your Apple products can be backed up into the cloud using WiFi when your device is charging (Muller and Neumayr). This feature allows any personal information and data to be easily restored if your device is ever lost or needs to be replaced by simply logging into your iCloud and restoring with WiFi (Muller and Neumayr).</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One advantage of incorporating iCloud into Apple products is that there can be an almost unlimited amount of iCloud storage to save music, photos, documents, messages, and applications that can also be shared with other people and devices (Tanhf).</li>
                <li>The biggest advantage of iCloud is that it can backup and restore data from Apple products at any time, and this backup can be restored on any Apple device (Tanhf). This is convenient when you buy a new Apple product as loss data from activating a new device is no longer an issue. </li>
                <li>It is also effortless to sync the data into the cloud because it not necessary to use a physical USB cord to sync the information (Tanhf). </li>
                <li>iCloud eliminates the user’s need to understand how to store information by simplifying the interface to a single button to back up to iCloud.</li>
                <li>By using this system, information is less likely to be lost; even if data is accidentally deleted, it can be recovered by going through recently deleted items stored in iCloud. </li>
                <li>This service has also sped up and reduced the cost of existing ways to store data which saves the industry from spending billions on physical data storage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <a name="disadvantages"></a>
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Disadvantageously, while the industry saves money, it can be a concern for consumers because they must commit to a monthly fee for additional storage which accrues over time, and some might not be able to afford or keep up with such fees.</li>
                <li>A second disadvantage of iCloud is that it is only available for iOS devices and PC (Tanhf), so other phones and devices like Android and Kindle cannot access iCloud features.</li>
                <li>Another major drawback of the service is the security and privacy of uploading and storing personal data to a third-party service and risking unauthorized access to the information (Tanhf).</li>
            </ul>

            <a name="conclusion"></a>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>iCloud was a revolutionary design that changed the way Apple users stored data and information in an era of competing modern technology. The design of iCloud included many features that were simple to use and extremely accessible which drew in millions of users, but at the cost of having users to commit to one network for their cloud computing needs. The invention of iCloud had a large impact on society and how companies presented cloud technology. The purpose of iCloud was to make storing and sharing information simple and efficient for users. iCloud brought the technology industry and humanity alike into a new era of cloud computing where storing data on the cloud can be easily and readily available for anyone and would forever change the way consumers used cloud computing technology.</p>
