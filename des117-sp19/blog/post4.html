                    <h2>A Look at Mobile and Desktop Design</h2>
                    <h3><time datetime="2019-05-09">May 9th, 2019</time>   </h3>
                    <div class="image"><img src="images/responsivedesign.png" alt="laptop in phone screen" width="216" height="300"></div>             
                    <p>Designing for both mobile and web are both equally important nowadays as more people are using their phones to surf the web. In the article “Desktop vs. mobile app design: how to optimize your user experience” explained the differences and advantages between mobile and web. The article discussed screen sizes, interactions, organization content, and functionality, it also mentioned some approaches to designing both layouts. I think it is important to design for both rather than just focusing on one design because it targets the majority of the users. One of the approaches the article mentioned was designing mobile-first, but I think this approach makes it difficult to design the desktop. This is because mobile screens require less content, but the web has such a large screen space to fill with content. I find that it is easier to organize the content once all of it is complete, rather than building content as the screens get bigger. Either way, both approaches prioritize elements in different ways when designing.</p>

                    <p>In the second article, “Rolling Out Responsive,” it discusses the advantages and disadvantages of responsive design, and how to ease users into a new redesign. Retrofit is just recoding some parts of the website, and the content and big designs are usually left alone. They also mention using beta to help users become comfortable with a new design, but they do state that it might be difficult to have all the employees and stakeholders to understand the purpose and consequences of beta. There may be negative feedback early on, but the purpose of beta is to be able to fix those issues before it is finalized. It also suggests doing a mobile-only responsive design, so that the desktop version does not need to change. This approach focuses on mobile users without risking losing desktop users. It gives some tips to make this launch successful, and it includes treating it like a beta and educating the team. The last approach they suggest is to redesign it section by section. They can start by redesigning a large and popular section and work their way to the non-popular sections, or they can start with a less popular section and change the more popular sections last. I think these are really good approaches to adding in responsive design, and incorporating multiple approaches could also be beneficial, like using beta for a mobile-only responsive site. However, it depends on the traffic of the site to pick the right approach, and I think will take a lot of planning to implement responsive design. </p>

                    <p>I use the web much more often than I used to because all of my classes require using a computer, either through using design software, coding, or watching online videos. I typically use my laptop to do schoolwork and occasionally browse through social media, but I mainly use my phone for social media. I tend not to use my phone for schoolwork because the screen is too small to do the work, but since social media does not need a larger screen to display all the content, it makes it appealing to just use it on my phone. I think that because social media has most traffic coming from mobile devices, it’s designed more towards mobile users. Instagram and Twitter are examples of this because people would not usually go on these sites on their desktop. It is just designed better on a phone. But I still think a lot of work needs to be done on mobile and desktop to have both performing at the same level. </p>
