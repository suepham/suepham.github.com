                    <h2>The Core Model</h2>
                    <h3><time datetime="2019-05-21">May 21st, 2019</time></h3>
                    <div class="image"><img src="images/coremodel.png" alt="core model" width="300" height="234"></div>   
                    <p>The article “The Core Model: Designing Inside Out for Better Results” discusses the necessary research and planning it takes beforehand to create a website. Ida Aalen uses the term “core model” to describe this type of approach, and it has achieved high success in the years following the NCS website launch. In order to use the model, it requires business objectives and user tasks, and keeping these goals in mind is helpful when redesigning a website. The core model helps the graphic designer, UX designer, web developer, content writer, etc. understand the purpose of the website and create a clear list of priorities to work on. The core model workshop pulls together puts stakeholders and members of the team together to fill out worksheets to share with one another. The main steps to the workshop are: 1) identify your cores, 2) plan for inward paths, 3) determine core content, 4) set forward paths, and 5) think mobile to prioritize. Doing these steps before creating the website increases the number of users and website impact in the end. Even though it’s a tedious process, it saves the company money in the end and increases user satisfaction. </p>

                    <p>I thought this article was very helpful for my career as a UX/UI designer and web developer because it broke down the core concepts to create and deliver a successful website. I knew that user research was very important in improving the usability for users, but I was always confused about how the rest of the team would understand and be on the same page. But after reading about the process and outcomes of the core model, it makes it easier to understand how the entire team can achieve a favorable design for the company and the users. I think it’s a really organized and manageable way to brainstorm and organize ideas/thoughts to build a website.</p>

                    <p>I thought it was interesting how the article suggested including stakeholders from relevant fields and departments because usually only the web team would work together but having people with different backgrounds brings in new ideas that some designers would not have thought of. I think that it’s a really good way to come up with better content because it’s similar to having more user research and coming up with new ideas to improve from the previous one. I also thought it was interesting to think about pages that would lead to the website because it shows that they are thinking in the perspective of the user. It makes it clearer for the designers to understand the context of where the users are coming from, and how they can address issues that users have when they arrive at the website. Having a core model helps fills in holes that designers do not realize are there.</p>
