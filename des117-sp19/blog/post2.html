                    <h2>My Experience with Semantic HTML</h2>
                    <h3><time datetime="2019-05-01">May 1st, 2019</time></h3>
                    <div class="image"><img src="images/markup.png" alt="HTML markup" width="350" height="259"></div> 
                    <p>“The Secrets of Semantic HTML5 for Document Structure — a Guide” was a good way to describe why marking up a document was necessary for the web, and it also cleared up some confusion about HTML. The article that I’m styling uses semantic tags that help the browser understand my content, and it does not use any non-semantic markup. The article also says that non-semantic tags can always be replaced by semantic tags, and that non-semantic tags do not give the browser any information about the content. This was good to know because it is easier to understand how to mark-up my content.</p>

                    <p>In my article, I chose to use header, nav, ul, li, article, section, footer, and a couple more. These helped describe my content because in my header, I had a main title for the whole article. I also had a nav section that linked to different sections in my article, and it was placed at the top near the header. I then my put article in an article tag and split each paragraph into its own section. At first, I did not know if an article tag belongs in a section tag or a section tag belongs in an article because I’ve seen examples of both situations. I chose to put my article in an article tag because it made sense to me that an article had different sections. The guide helped me understand that a section is part of a whole, so the way I marked up my article followed the general rule. I also used a footer to add in the valid HTML link because it belonged on the bottom of the page, and it did not fit in with the rest of my content.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my blog post, I am trying to place the navigation below the header, and then place the article posts in reverse chronological order. The footer will also go on the bottom with a navigation for other links. So far, I have a single column with the posts, and I have an aside that has an image of me and a description of myself. I might change this and make the posts take up two columns instead of having myself on the side because the design looks a bit awkward with the aside so far. On the article page, I want to have the next post be below the article, with just an image and the title, so the user can click on it when they reach the end of my article. The article page will also have the same header, navigation, and footer design as the front page to keep it consistent.</p>
                    
                    <p>I thought it was really challenging to style the posts because I wanted to make it clean, but also different from other blogs. I wanted to keep the design pattern consistent with other blogs, but I did not want it to look generic. This part took me the longest to figure out because I had to figure out a way to present the content without it looking too cluttered or out of place. This is something I’m still figuring out, and I plan on experimenting with multiple columns to present my content.</p>
