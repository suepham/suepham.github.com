				<h1><a href="marbles.html">Vexel Trace of Marbles</a></h1>
				<p>I traced a stock image of marbles using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to see how my skills have improved after I took my graphics design class, so I decided to recreate the image of marbles. The original image was also very pixelated, so by recreating it on Illustrator, it made the image clearer and cleaner.</p>

				<h1><a href="room.html">Interior of a Room</a></h1>
				<p>This was a project in my graphic design class, and I had to create an interior of a room using Adobe Illustrator. It had to be a two-point perspective, so I first drew out the ideas of the furniture in the room and then drew multiple sketches of the room. I created a natural, analogous, complementary, and monochromatic version of the room.</p>

				<h1><a href="typography.html">Typography Poster</a></h1>
				<p>This was a project in my graphic design course where I had to create a poster showcasing one of the top 100 fonts--I was given Weiss. We used Adobe Illustrator to complete this project. The main goal was to learn how to use colors and the visual hierarchy to convey the importance of the font.</p>

				<h1><a href="legacyevent.html">Legacy Event Poster</a></h1>
				<p>This was a project in my graphic design course. We had to create a poster for an event on a subject who has left a legacy, and I chose Charles Dickens because of his great collection of written books. This project required us to blend images together in Adobe Photoshop and transfer it over to Adobe Illustrator where we would add in the text. </p>

				<h1><a href="legacy.html">Legacy Poster</a></h1>
				<p>This was a project in my graphic design course, and we had to use Adobe Photoshop to create a poster that showed the legacy that was left behind by someone. I chose Charles Dickens and the novels that he wrote. The only text we could use was their name and the years they lived. I chose to add the illustrations that would show others the main idea of each of his books.</p>
