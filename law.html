			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>This project was the final project for my JavaScript course at UC Davis. This project would be submitted to the 2020 <a href="https://beijing2020.iamcr.org/cfp" target="_blank">IAMCR conference</a> which calls for proposals of projects that cover the theme "Reimagining the Digital Future: Building Inclusiveness, Respect and Reciprocity." I chose to cover the topic on sustainability and plastic pollution because I felt that it was an immediate issue in the world that could be fixed by a change in our human behavior.</p>
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p>Plastic pollution has become a major problem in the world because most of the plastic is not biodegradable or recycled. The plastic remains on the Earth for hundreds of years where it will break down into microplastics, and ingested by humans and animals as well.</p>
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>The idea was to create a website that would help people understand the lifecycle of plastic bottles, and therefore would lower the usage of plastic water bottles after they understand how harmful it is to the environment.</p>
			<h4>Goals</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Build an interactive website using JavaScript</li>
				<li>Design a unique interface that engages the user</li>
				<li>Address the theme of sustainability through content and visual design</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<h4>Brainstorm</h4>
			<p>I created a structured mind map to brainstorm the topic for my final project. I picked five topics I was interested in and passionate about, and I created branches off of that idea. I tried to understand what the main issues were in order to create a solution with my website.<img src="images/brainstorm.png" width="600" alt="Brainstorm"></p>

			<h4>Research</h4>
			<h5>Comparative Research</h5>
			<p>After selecting my topic on climate change, I did some research on existing projects to see how they are interactive and engaging to the user. I looked at the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA Climate Change</a> website and the <a href="https://livegreen.io" target="_blank">LiveGreen</a> app.</p>
			<h6>NASA Climate Change Website</h6>
			<p>
				<img src="images/nasa1.png" width="400" alt="Front page of NASA website"><br> 
				I thought the moving images and statistics on the front page were really engaging to the user because it included an interactive slideshow for users to learn more and visually see. The moving images intrigued me to look through the website because the interface was visually interesting.
				<img src="images/nasa2.png" width="400" alt="Climate section of NASA website"><br> 
				In this section, I thought the moving image in the background helped make the information more interesting because there was constant motion. The microinteractions that the user had in this section, like changing the information inside the circles on hover, also helped the user stay engaged
			</p>
			<h6>LiveGreen App</h6>
			<p>

				<img src="images/livegreen4.jpg" width="120" alt="LiveGreen screen 4">
				<br>The LiveGreen app had a new approach to creating an account that I enjoyed because their login process mimicked the style of sending texts. It was different from the standard that I was used to, but it was also extremely engaging as well.
			</p>
			<h5>Academic Research</h5>
			<p>I looked at information on my topic to learn more about plastic pollution. It would also help me in adding statistics and facts in my website to help users learn. I looked at four sources of information: two TED Talks, an article on The Guardian, and a Buzzfeed video.</p>
			<h6><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emma_bryce_what_really_happens_to_the_plastic_you_throw_away#t-787" target="_blank">TED Talk</a>: What really happens to the plastic you throw away? - Emma Bryce</h6>
			<p>This TED Talk discusses the lifecycle of plastic from how it’s created to where it goes when it gets thrown away. It gave me valuable information on the effects of plastic in the world and where the plastic may end up depending on how humans dispose of it. </p>
			<h6><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/alejandro_duran_how_i_use_art_to_tackle_plastic_pollution_in_our_oceans#t-424909" target="_blank">TED Talk</a>: How I use art to tackle plastic pollution in our oceans - Alejandro Duran</h6>
			<p>In this TED Talk, artist Alejandro Duran talks about his journey with art and plastic. He begins with how he visited a beach, but it was covered in plastic that washed up to the shore from countries around the world. He then started cleaning up the plastic and arranging them based on the colors to form his photography and art. I wanted to incorporate something like this in my website would help reduce the use of plastic because it sends a message to people on how their actions impact the world.</p>
			<h6><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-climate-change-hazard-study-warns" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>: Single-use plastics a serious climate change hazard study warns</h6>
			<p>This article in The Guardian talks about the plastic cradle to grave lifecycle and how it is impacting the Earth. The statistics that they provide were terrifying to read, and I want to include the statistics they listed in the article on my website because it will provide context and information for the user.</p>
			<h6><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrqvpLt1tc" target="_blank">BuzzFeed Video</a>: Home Chef Tries The No Trash Trader Joe's Challenge</h6>
			<p>This Buzzfeed video follows Stevie who lives a zero-waste life, and she attempts to shop at Trader Joes to create a side dish without purchasing anything with plastic. It was interesting to see her thought process while she was shopping in Trader Joes. It shows how easy it can be to live a zero-waste life because she just found a more creative way to make something, so she doesn’t have to buy the ingredient in packaging. I thought that including personal stories or things that people do to life a plastic-free life on the website would make it easier for other people to change because they see that other people can do it.</p>
			<h5>User Research</h5>
			<p>For my user research, I created two different personas with Xtensio. Since my topic is on sustainability, I created a persona (pink) of a user who is environmentally aware, and they want to learn how to live a more sustainable life. The second persona (blue) is an average person who has the usual daily activities and worries. I thought that since these two personas are the probably two main categories of users that will be visiting the website, I wanted to see what their goals and personalities are. This helps me know what the users will be looking for when they go on my website, and I can create content that will fit their needs.
