            <h3>Academic Research</h3>
            <p>I looked at four sources of information: two TED Talks, an article on The Guardian, and a Buzzfeed video. They all gave me additional information on my topic of plastic pollution, but it also gave me ideas on how to build my website.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emma_bryce_what_really_happens_to_the_plastic_you_throw_away#t-787">TED Talk</a>: What really happens to the plastic you throw away? - Emma Bryce</h4>
            <p>This TED Talk discusses the lifecycle of plastic from how it’s created to where it goes when it gets thrown away. The video gave me inspiration on how the layout of my website will be on this topic. They used graphics that showed how plastic moves from one location to another, and I want to do something similar as the user scrolls through the website. It also gave me valuable information on the effects of plastic in the world and where the plastic may end up depending on how humans dispose of it. It gave me a visual to the information that they were saying, so it helped me understand the severity of plastic.</p>

            <p>In this TED Talk, artist Alejandro Duran talks about his journey with art and plastic. He begins with how he visited a beach, but it was covered in plastic that washed up to the shore from countries around the world. He then started cleaning up the plastic and arranging them based on the colors to form his photography and art. After seeing his art, I thought it looked beautiful, but it was also heartbreaking to see how much plastic is left on Earth. I think incorporating something like this in my website would help reduce the use of plastic because it sends a message to people on how their actions impact the world. It forces people to look at how their single decision of using plastic can change the ecosystem in the ocean.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-climate-change-hazard-study-warns">The Guardian</a>: Single-use plastics a serious climate change hazard study warns</h4>
            <p>This article in The Guardian talks about the plastic cradle to grave lifecycle and how it is impacting the Earth. They estimate that “the CO2 emissions from plastic could grow to more than 2.75 billion tons by 2050,” and they said this will cause the global temperatures to rise if we do not stop our use of plastic. It also directly mentions four ways to stop this from impacting the Earth. 99% of the plastic is made from fossil fuels, and the majority of the plastic is used for packaging. This takes uses the natural resources in the Earth, and it pollutes the Earth with plastic that takes thousands of years to break down. The statistics that they provide are terrifying to read because it is almost impossible to imagine the severity of plastic use. I want to include the statistics they listed in the article on my website because it will provide context and information for the user.</p>

            <h4><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrqvpLt1tc">BuzzFeed Video</a>: Home Chef Tries The No Trash Trader Joe's Challenge</h4>
            <p>This Buzzfeed video follows Stevie who lives a zero-waste life, and she attempts to shop at Trader Joes to create a side dish without purchasing anything with plastic. It was interesting to see her thought process while she was shopping in Trader Joes. When buying the ingredients, she felt horrible about buying the yeast in plastic packaging, but she tried to find alternative ways to make the cream base in the dish without buying the cashews in plastic packaging. It shows how easy it can be to live a zero-waste life because she just found a more creative way to make something, so she doesn’t have to buy the ingredient in packaging. I think that including personal stories or things that people do to life a plastic-free life on the website would make it easier for other people to change because they see that other people can do it. </p>
